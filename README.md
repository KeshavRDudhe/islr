# ISLR-Python

[**ISLR**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) is a very comprehensive notebook for understanding the basic statistical learning. However, all the sample code and exercises are based on R. Recently, I'd like to reinforce my foundation in related statistics field, therefore, I will go through the entire book with my favorite programming language Python.
